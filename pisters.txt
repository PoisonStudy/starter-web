Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. What's wrong with being a lawyer? I am sorry. 
What happened to your father was business. I have much respect for your 
father. But your father, his thinking is old-fashioned. You must understand dsadsadsa
why I had to do that. Now let's work through where we go from here. I know 
it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! This one time, this
 one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Never let anyone know what 
 you are thinking. Do me this favor.

I won't forget it. Ask your friends in 
 the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. 
 You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? 
 Or my boy to me? I don't trust a doctor who can hardly speak English. My 
 father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me:
 keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
